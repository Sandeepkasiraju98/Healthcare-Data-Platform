# Healthcare-Data-Platform

This project is a **scalable Electronic Health Records (EHR) Simulation Platform** designed for healthcare analytics, interoperability experimentation, and real-time data insights. It leverages a robust modern stack‚Äî**Python, R, Flask, Docker, Spark, Hadoop, MongoDB, AWS EC2, Power BI**‚Äîto enable ETL automation, distributed processing, cloud-native deployment, and advanced statistical validation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Modular RESTful APIs:**  
  Flask-based APIs for data ingestion, access, and management of simulated EHR datasets.

- **Containerized ETL Workflows:**  
  Automated data extraction, transformation, and loading using Dockerized pipelines for consistent, scalable processing.

- **Distributed Data Processing:**  
  Integrated **Apache Spark** and **Hadoop** engines for big data computation, supporting large-volume healthcare analytics and fast query performance.

- **Data Storage:**  
  Utilizes **MongoDB** for storing semi-structured clinical data, supporting flexible schema evolution.

- **Cloud Deployment:**  
  Easily deployed and orchestrated on **AWS EC2**, allowing horizontal scaling and robust infrastructure for production use cases.

- **Real-Time Dashboards:**  
  Live data visualization and KPI monitoring powered by **Power BI**, enabling users to monitor operational and clinical metrics in real time.

- **Integrated R-Python Workflows:**  
  Seamlessly combines R and Python processes for advanced statistical validation, data science, and automation‚Äîvital for healthcare research and regulatory requirements.
